## Introduction

The Crocuta crocuta, more commonly known as spotted hyena, is the largest of three hyena species (striped hyena, brown hyena, and aardwolf). They appear to be similar to dogs, but more closely related to cats. They live throughout much of Africa, Arabia to India. Females lead spotted hyenas, and they live together in clans that may have up to 100 hyenas. Scientists have recorded over 11 different vocalizations made by spotted hyenas, making them the most vocal mammals in Africa.

The length from head to tail is about 95 to 150 cm and the height is about 75 cm to 85cm. The tail is about 30 to 36 cm long and ends in a bushy black tip. Male weight ranges from 45 to 60 kg and females weigh 55 to over 70 kg.

**Hunting Behavior:**

Hyenas do not kill their prey directly; the prey is captured and eaten while still alive. The victim dies from shock and loss of blood as it is torn apart and pulled down. They have different hunting techniques based on the size and type of prey. They get up to 75% of their food from their own kills. The spotted hyena tracks live prey by sight, hearing and smell.

• **Big Prey:** When hyenas hunt an animal that is bigger than themselves, they hunt more like a dog or wolf, hunting down the prey as a group. They take down the prey by biting into it and pulling it into the ground. Examples: wildebeest, antelope, zebras and young hippos.

• **Small Prey:** When hunting weak or smaller prey, they hunt individually. Examples: birds, fish, snakes, lizards and insects.

## Previous Enrichment Testing

• [Innovative Problem Solving by Wild Spotted Hyenas](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427591/pdf/rspb20121450.pdf) - Sarah Benson-Amram and Kay E. Holekamp

At the Department of Zoology of Michigan State University, they wanted to test whether the Crocuta crocuta is an innovative animal, which is an animal able to solve new problems or find new solutions to existing problems. The study was conducted in their natural habitat in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. They built a steel puzzle box that was presented to the hyenas. It was big enough to allow for a hyena to put its head inside the box, and the spacing between the bars of the box was sufficient to allow hyenas to see and smell the meat inside. To be able to reach the meat, the hyena would have to slide a bolt latch laterally, and swing open the door; it could be opened using either the mouth or the forepaws.

Spotted hyenas are incredibly adept at solving social problems, but only 15% of them managed to solve open the box. Those successful hyenas became faster at opening the puzzle box over successive trials. This study showed that hyenas learn via trial and error. 

Juveniles showed greater exploration diversity, spent more time working on the puzzle and were less neophobic than adults. Neither sex nor social rank affected exploration diversity, work time, or neophobia.

• [Hyena Project](http://lilyjohnsonulrich.weebly.com/my-research.html) - Lily Johnson-Ulrich

Lily Johnson-Ulrich starts her research with thinking that because neural tissue is costly, people have agreed that big brains must be adaptive. One of the most conventional explanations for the evolution of intelligence is the Social Brain Hypothesis, which argues that intelligence did not evolve primarily as a means to solve ecological problems, but rather as a means of surviving and reproducing in large and complex social groups. This hypothesis has been strongly supported by work on primates where higher degrees of social complexity are correlated with enhanced social cognition. The cognitive buffer hypothesis suggests that big brains enhance overall behavioral flexibility and allow individuals to respond effectively to rapidly changing or novel environments. Johnson-Ulrich is testing out predictions of the SBH and CBH hypotheses by testing two cognitive abilities: innovation and inhibitory control, in spotted hyenas.

Hyenas exhibit larger overall brains and proportionally larger frontal cortex than those seen in other extant hyenas or other carnivores. The size of their frontal cortex and the similarity between hyena and primate societies predict that hyenas should do comparably well on cognitive tasks. 

This is an ongoing research project that hasn't been published yet, but I have added some in the field photographs.

Social Complexity Hypothesis: Same as social brain hypothesis, which proposes that the advanced social and cognitive skills
of some species evolved due to the selection pressure of group living.  Spotted hyenas have advanced social cognitive
abilities similar to primates, for example, being able to identify individuals within their clan, recognize kin, and learn about social ranks of other clan members. 


The spotted hyenas problem solving was tested  by presenting six spotted hyenas with a series of puzzle boxes. All of the  test subjects were similar in size and had been in a zoo for about 3 years. The animals were given 30 to 40 minutes to solve each puzzle

• **Remove Bowl Puzzle:** Solved by all hyenas.

• **Puzzle Box:**

• **Cable Puzzle:**

• **Lazy Susan Puzzle:** Solved by all hyenas.

• **Remove Lid Puzzle:**

• **Plunger Puzzle:** Solved by only one hyena.

Overall the spotted hyenas were capable of solving the majority of the puzzle boxes. All of the spotted hyenas solved puzzles with a low level of difficulty where they simply had to pull the bowl out of the front of the box with their paw or mouth. Success was more variable when it came to medium difficulty puzzles where the solution involved a type of pulling motion either with the mouth or paws. They were generally unsuccessful at solving the high difficulty puzzle like the Plunger Puzzle that required the food to be pushed away from them to be accessed.

## Prototype

Based on the previous findings, we wanted to design a device that would use a hyena's ability to bite down and pull, their cooperative behavior and their ability to problem solve.
