Vulpes vulpes, more commonly known as Red Foxes, are members of the Canidae family. They eat a variety of food, sometimes changing their diet from season to season. They are considered opportunistic feeders who will feed based on availability. Their diets usually include small rodents, rabbits, hare, insects, wild fruits and berries. Foxes are great at scavenging, hunting and caching. They carefully hide food for future us by burying it underground and disguising the spot with leaves and twigs. They will sometimes relocate their provisions.

Red Foxes are predators of small pray; these animals are high-strung and have quick reactions, which means that foxes have to stalk their prey quietly to be able to catch them. A fox's hearing is very sensitive to lower noises, frequencies that correspond to rustling and gnawing sounds of small animals. They are capable of locating sounds within inches of their exact location.

**Types of prey:**

J. David Henry groups the types of animals Red Foxes eat, into 4 main groups:

* **Insects:** Crickets, grasshoppers, and beetles. Sometimes flies and moths. 

* **Lagomorphs:** Includes rabbits and hares, who flee by running.

* **Small Burrowing Animals:** They flee down a burrow or dash under objects like rocks or fallen trees.

* **Arboreal Prey:** Birds and tree squirrels. These animals have high visual acuity, they flee upwards, and they keep a watch for predators from high perches.

The techniques that foxes use to hunts these types of prey is also different, each one unique to the circumstances. 

**Hunting Techniques:**

* **Insects:**
Hunting insects is something that foxes do more casually. Insects have weak escape behaviors, and they only provide the fox with a small amount of food. Usually, foxes are doing something else, and they hear an insect, and they simply walk over and bite down. When insects hop or fly away, they use their muzzle to poke around, or they do something called foot stamping. The foot stomping causes insects to move, and then the fox is able to locate them by the sound of rustling or movement.

**Previous enrichment testing:**

[Feeding enrichment in an opportunistic carnivore: The red fox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228488070_Feeding_enrichment_in_an_opportunistic_carnivore_The_red_fox)

Claudia Kistler,  Daniel Hegglin, Hanno Würbel, Barbara König

They compared four different methods of feeding enrichment that were based on natural foraging strategies of opportunistic carnivores, red foxes. The feeding enrichments consisted of electronic feeders delivering food unpredictable in time which were successively combined with one of the three additional treatments: a self-service food box, manually scattering food (unpredictable in space), and an electronic dispenser delivering food unpredictably both in space and time.

All four feeding enrichments significantly enhanced individual behavioral diversity and activity compared to a conventional feeding treatment. The proportion of food-related behaviors, such as food searching or food acquiring, increased the most during the feeding treatment with the highest spatial and temporal unpredictability. There was also an increase in exploratory behaviors, such as locomotion and monitoring behavior. The findings show that any temporal and/or spatial unpredictability in the presentation of food has a stimulating effect on the foxes’ behavior.
