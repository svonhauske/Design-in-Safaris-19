## Final

I started out by choosing my 1st proposal; the preybot that imitated a flying bird or a running squirrel, so the first thing I wanted to solve was how to hang kibble from it. I did some research on edible materials that could encapsulate the kibble and that the fox could eat as well, instead of trying to create some sort of container. After looking at several possibilities, I decided to try gelatine. 

This is how it turned out:


After this, I wanted to tackle my second most significant challenge; finding a strong enough motor. I did some research, found a couple of different options, but with each one, new problem arrised. Due to time constraints and the fact that I do not have that much experience with motors, I decided to move on from my 1st proposal, and start working on my 3rd proposal.
