## Final

I started out by choosing my 1st proposal; the preybot that imitated a flying bird or a running squirrel, so the first thing I wanted to solve was how to hang kibble from it. I did some research on edible materials that could encapsulate the kibble and that the fox could eat as well, instead of trying to create some sort of container. After looking at several possibilities, I decided to try gelatine.
