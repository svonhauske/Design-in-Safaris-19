## Changes from last week

I initially thought about making this out of wood, plywood specifically. Plywood is durable and has cross-graining, which reduces the tendency of wood to split, it reduces expansion and shrinkage, and it makes the strength of the panel consistent across all directions. Instead of wood, since this will be out in the open, I decided to go with plastic for the actual prototype, because it will make it more durable when subjected to bad weather.

These are the dimensions I started out with:

They whole device was a lot bigger than I wanted, mostly becuase of the dispensing mechanism I had come up with:

This first ideation required:

- Arduino
- 2 Servo motors
- 4 PIR Sensors
- 1 MP3 Shield
- 1 speaker

As I was testing out my electronic components, I discovered that having one PIR sensor on top of the device was enough and that having 4, one on each side was unnecessary.

### Interaction

My interaction flow stayed the same.

**Zookeper:** Activates the low-frequency sound through bluetooth.

**Fox:** Hears sound and tries to pin-point its location.

**Device:** Waits for movement.

**Fox:** Approaches device with either muzzle or by stamping close by.

**Device:** Detects movement, dispenses treat and launches it into the air like a flying insect.

**Fox:** Catches treat.
