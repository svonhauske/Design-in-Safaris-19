## Designing for Humans
01/28/2019

   Anthropomorphism is defined as the attribution of human characteristics or behavior to a god, animal, or object. As industrial designers, we often let anthropomorphism dictate the form of our products and the process we go through when designing them. We want people to buy our products and people like things that are familiar to them. We are taught to design with our user in mind, but it is rare that we ever have to design something that does not have a human attached to at least one side of a product. Although, it is beneficial to take into account how humans may interact with a product or system we must also look at designing through a wider lens by taking into account that not everything behaves like a human and not every user is human.  
  
   Industrial designers are taught to observe how humans interact with the environment around them and are encouraged to design objects that provide an optimal experience for them. Countless hours and money are spent during the research and development phase of a project to ensure that the end product will appeal to people and be comfortable for them to use. Anthropomorphism in industrial design helps the designer evoke feelings and emotions by giving the product something that mimics a smile or a frown; it makes the product more human and less object. Theoretically, this an ideal way of designing, but, how effective is it when we are not designing for humans?  

   We design products as if humans were the only beings interacting with it, but many of the things we design interact with other beings like plants and animals. We design dog beds that would fit into our apartments’ decor, but we don’t stop and wonder if our dog is sleeping on it because they find it comfortable or because we give them no other choice. I’ve personally witnessed the development of a project that wanted to reimagine the dog leash. The team wanted to make it more ergonomic and easier to use for the person holding the leash. Interviews and tests were carried out, focusing on dog owners as well as dog walkers, but not much attention was paid to the other end of the leash.  Are dog leashes as good as they get when it comes to the dog side? Could making it a better experience for the dog, make it better for the human as well?  
  
   Traditional methods of research such as interviews and questionnaires are great resources to gather user based information. However, these cannot be conducted in the conventional sense when we are designing for a nonhuman user. We must then make sure to conduct interviews with experts to gather information and carry out observations that will provide us with nuanced behavior.   
  
   We tend to think that everything else in the world functions like a human, so we are ultimately making incorrect assumptions when we are designing a product. We are not the only living beings in our environment, we are surrounded by others, that whether they like it or not, have to interact with what we design. We have birds flying through are buildings, rats running through our sewers, trees spreading their roots under our concrete, pets cohabitating in our homes. It is our duty as designers to create an optimum experience for our end user whether that is human or non-human, so we need to gain a new perspective. To be able to achieve this we must step out of this anthropomorphic approach, leave all of our assumptions at the door, observe with an open mind, and learn from those who have more experience than us in the field.

## First Try at Ethograms
02/03/2019

   My first go at ethograms was challenging. A lot of my time was spent watching different types of felines sleep; I hadn't realized that they slept so much, even during the day. Using live cams also made it difficult, because sometimes animals would walk out of range or the camera would focus on another animal, interrupting the observations I was writing down. I discovered that it is a lot easier when the live cam is recording few individuals, so for my ethograms, I chose two live feeds from the San Diego Zoo; Polar Bears and Elephants. 

   I used pen and paper for both my ethograms, as I was not able to get the Zoo Monitor App working. Luckily I had recorded the videos I was going to use because I tried doing a continuous sampling and it would have been impossible if I was doing it out on the field. It is tough to put down the behavior, the description, and the duration all at the same time. If I had not been able to pause the video, I would have missed many important behaviors and details. The pen and paper method was convenient because I was using my laptop to watch the animals, and this way, that was the only thing I needed to have on my screen. For my next try, I would like to go out to the field and do an all occurrences sampling. I am hoping that I can move around enough so that I am always able to see the animal and I think this type of sampling is simpler and more effective for this situation. 
   
   The ethogram exercise was very useful, because I watched several behaviors that in isolation would not have meant anything to me. The polar bear ethogram helped me realize that the bear I was observing was "afraid" of the other polar bear. When I first watched the video I recorded, I noticed several behaviors that I thought were completely unrelated, but after watching it again and putting down all the behaviors and descriptions, I realized that a lot of them were in response to this "fear" or this interaction between the two bears.

## Empathy Machines
02/10/2019

### First Attempt: Researching Animals

First I started by researching animals; I started looking into interesting behaviors that they had, or exciting ways in which they sensed things. One of the things that I found really interesting and that I went a little more deeply into was Firefly communication. Fireflies have different flying and lighting patterns that lets them communicate with their species and attract females. I had a couple of ideas of physical and digital games that had to do with this, but I wasn't really convinced. Starting out with research was not really getting me to where I wanted.

![firefly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52544532-6039ad80-2d7f-11e9-9998-c70df796e1ec.jpg)
- [Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/educational-resources/talk-like-a-firefly/)
- [NPS](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/firefly-flash-patterns.htm)

 So I decided to start by thinking about empathy. 

### Thinking About Empathy

The first thing that came to my mind when I thought of empathy was something that happened back home in Mexico while I was visiting last year. I have two dogs back home, and I always travel with my dog from here; they are all rescues, so they already a little bit afraid of things. There is a church a couple of blocks away that celebrates several saints throughout the year, and they throw this big block party that goes on until 6 AM. There are fireworks all night long, and my dogs get really scared. They start shaking like crazy, they hide under the furniture and they won't come out, and there is nothing we can do about it. This time, my mom decided to call the church. It was about 2 AM when this happened. She managed to get in contact with the priest; he was in charge of the celebration. She explained why she was calling and politely asked him to stop lighting up fireworks, to which the priest responded: "Animals are replaceable." and hung up the phone. 

This is a picture of the Church:

From here I decided to do more research on hearing, and the effect that loud noises and noise pollution, in general, has on wildlife. 


### Hearing in Animals

As I started searching for more information on this, I kept coming across things like this:
![news](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52544882-9f68fe00-2d81-11e9-8205-5e219b9a1b24.jpg)

News reports are mostly about marine life and the effect of noise pollution on them, but they aren't the only ones getting affected.

### Noise Pollution

What is noise pollution? A noise is an unwanted or inappropriate sound. Noise pollution is noise that interferes with normal activities, and disrupts or diminishes our quality of life. [PBS News Hour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/noise-pollution-humans-wreaking-havoc-u-s-wildlife)

Noise Pollution Effects:

* Flying Species:
  - Changes the distribution of birds, affecting trees and plants.
  - Some bird species have demonstrated adjustments to their vocal behaviour in an attempt to adapt. 
  - Some birds species have begun to sing at night.
  
* Land Species: 
  - Female frogs have more difficulty locating the male's signal.
  - Reduces in the size of an area in which predators can hear their prey, and the ability of animals to avoid predators.
  - High-intensity sound induces fear, sometimes forcing species to abandon their habitat.
  - It can alter their established behaviours like vigilance, foraging, resting and their social interactions.

* Marine Species:
  - Damage a cetacean’s hearing and interfere with their sonar navigation system, leaving them stranded.
  - Physical trauma like bleeding around the ears, brain and other tissues, and air bubbles in their organs. ("The Bends")
  - Some species have started avoiding areas that were previously breeding or feeding grounds.
  - Different species have suffered behavioural changes when communicating.
  - Cephalopods suffer damage to their statocyst, the organ responsible for their maintaining balance in the water.

### Animal Pinnae

What is Pinnae? Pinnae are the external part of the ears in humans and other mammals. I decided to focus on the pinnae because I think it is something we often overlook or take for granted when we are thinking about hearing.

Some animals can swivel or rotate their pinnae in order to pinpoint where sounds are coming from. For predators, it is helpful while hunting, to find their prey, and for the animals being hunted, it helps them avoid predators.  

Examples:
* Foxes: Foxes can rotate pinnae up to 150 degrees.
* Canines
* Felines: Cats can rotate pinnae up to 180 degrees.
* Equines: Horses can rotate pinnae up to 180 degrees.
* Porcines
* Ungulates
* Rodents

### How can I design something that let's humans experience an animal's ability to rotate their pinna and focus on a sound?

First Step: Interior Mechanism

I started out by building out the mechanism I would need. I was going to use a servo motor to make the pinna rotate and since I wanted to somehow tie it back to muscle control, I decided to use a flex sensor. Bending the sensor with your finger would control the degrees of rotation of the servo.

This is what my circuit looks like:

Second Step: Code

```C++
// Servo library

#include <Servo.h> 

Servo servo1;

const int flexpin = 0; 

void setup() 
{ 

  Serial.begin(9600);

  servo1.attach(7);
} 

void loop() 
{ 
  int flexposition;  
  int servoposition;   

  flexposition = analogRead(flexpin);

  servoposition = map(flexposition, 100, 300, 0, 180);
  servoposition = constrain(servoposition, 0, 180);


  servo1.write(servoposition);

  //Serial.print("sensor: ");
  //Serial.print(flexposition);
  //Serial.print("  servo: ");
  //Serial.println(servoposition);

  delay(20); 
}
```

Third Step: Exterior

Fourth Step: Testing

Results:

People found this fun and interesting. They really liked being able to control it with their finger. It did make them realize how hard it is to focus and pinpoint a sound in general, but even more when several things were happening around them.In terms of the volume, they could hear a slight change when rotating the ear towards a sound, but the motor and friction produced too much noise.

Ideally, this would be made out of nylon or with bearings to reduce friction and noise. The ear pinna is modeled after a small sized red fox ear, but maybe testing out larger sizes would make the effect greater.
