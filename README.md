## Designing for Humans
01/28/2019

   Anthropomorphism is defined as the attribution of human characteristics or behavior to a god, animal, or object. As industrial designers, we often let anthropomorphism dictate the form of our products and the process we go through when designing them. We want people to buy our products and people like things that are familiar to them. We are taught to design with our user in mind, but it is rare that we ever have to design something that does not have a human attached to at least one side of a product. Although, it is beneficial to take into account how humans may interact with a product or system we must also look at designing through a wider lens by taking into account that not everything behaves like a human and not every user is human.  
  
   Industrial designers are taught to observe how humans interact with the environment around them and are encouraged to design objects that provide an optimal experience for them. Countless hours and money are spent during the research and development phase of a project to ensure that the end product will appeal to people and be comfortable for them to use. Anthropomorphism in industrial design helps the designer evoke feelings and emotions by giving the product something that mimics a smile or a frown; it makes the product more human and less object. Theoretically, this an ideal way of designing, but, how effective is it when we are not designing for humans?  

   We design products as if humans were the only beings interacting with it, but many of the things we design interact with other beings like plants and animals. We design dog beds that would fit into our apartments’ decor, but we don’t stop and wonder if our dog is sleeping on it because they find it comfortable or because we give them no other choice. I’ve personally witnessed the development of a project that wanted to reimagine the dog leash. The team wanted to make it more ergonomic and easier to use for the person holding the leash. Interviews and tests were carried out, focusing on dog owners as well as dog walkers, but not much attention was paid to the other end of the leash.  Are dog leashes as good as they get when it comes to the dog side? Could making it a better experience for the dog, make it better for the human as well?  
  
   Traditional methods of research such as interviews and questionnaires are great resources to gather user based information. However, these cannot be conducted in the conventional sense when we are designing for a nonhuman user. We must then make sure to conduct interviews with experts to gather information and carry out observations that will provide us with nuanced behavior.   
  
   We tend to think that everything else in the world functions like a human, so we are ultimately making incorrect assumptions when we are designing a product. We are not the only living beings in our environment, we are surrounded by others, that whether they like it or not, have to interact with what we design. We have birds flying through are buildings, rats running through our sewers, trees spreading their roots under our concrete, pets cohabitating in our homes. It is our duty as designers to create an optimum experience for our end user whether that is human or non-human, so we need to gain a new perspective. To be able to achieve this we must step out of this anthropomorphic approach, leave all of our assumptions at the door, observe with an open mind, and learn from those who have more experience than us in the field.

## Ethograms
02/03/2019

   My first go at ethograms was challenging. A lot of my time was spent watching different types of felines sleep; I hadn't realized that they slept so much, even during the day. Using live cams also made it difficult, because sometimes animals would walk out of range or the camera would focus on another animal, interrupting the observations I was writing down. I discovered that it is a lot easier when the live cam is recording few individuals, so for my ethograms, I chose two live feeds from the San Diego Zoo; Polar Bears and Elephants. 

   I used pen and paper for both my ethograms, as I was not able to get the Zoo Monitor App working. Luckily I had recorded the videos I was going to use because I tried doing a continuous sampling and it would have been impossible if I was doing it out on the field. It is tough to put down the behavior, the description, and the duration all at the same time. If I had not been able to pause the video, I would have missed many important behaviors and details. The pen and paper method was convenient because I was using my laptop to watch the animals, and this way, that was the only thing I needed to have on my screen. For my next try, I would like to go out to the field and do an all occurrences sampling. I am hoping that I can move around enough so that I am always able to see the animal and I think this type of sampling is simpler and more effective for this situation. 
   
   The ethogram exercise was very useful, because I watched several behaviors that in isolation would not have meant anything to me. The polar bear ethogram helped me realize that the bear I was observing was "afraid" of the other polar bear. When I first watched the video I recorded, I noticed several behaviors that I thought were completely unrelated, but after watching it again and putting down all the behaviors and descriptions, I realized that a lot of them were in response to this "fear" or this interaction between the two bears.

## Empathy Machine
02/10/2019

### First Attempt: Researching Animals

First I started by researching animals; I started looking into interesting behaviors that they had, or exciting ways in which they sensed things. One of the things that I found really interesting and that I went a little more deeply into was Firefly communication. Fireflies have different flying and lighting patterns that lets them communicate with their species and attract females. I had a couple of ideas of physical and digital games that had to do with this, but I wasn't really convinced. Starting out with research was not really getting me to where I wanted.

![firefly](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52544532-6039ad80-2d7f-11e9-9998-c70df796e1ec.jpg)
- [Science Friday](https://www.sciencefriday.com/educational-resources/talk-like-a-firefly/)
- [NPS](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/learn/nature/firefly-flash-patterns.htm)

 So I decided to start by thinking about empathy. 

### Thinking About Empathy

The first thing that came to my mind when I thought of empathy was something that happened back home in Mexico while I was visiting last year. I have two dogs back home, and I always travel with my dog from here; they are all rescues, so they already a little bit afraid of things. There is a church a couple of blocks away that celebrates several saints throughout the year, and they throw this big block party that goes on until 6 AM. There are fireworks all night long, and my dogs get really scared. They start shaking like crazy, they hide under the furniture and they won't come out, and there is nothing we can do about it. This time, my mom decided to call the church. It was about 2 AM when this happened. She managed to get in contact with the priest; he was in charge of the celebration. She explained why she was calling and politely asked him to stop lighting up fireworks, to which the priest responded: "Animals are replaceable." and hung up the phone. 

This is a picture of the Church:
![3350843466_80204db618_b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52544673-1d2c0a00-2d80-11e9-86c1-15d243a5237b.jpg)

From here I decided to do more research on hearing, and the effect that loud noises and noise pollution, in general, has on wildlife. 


### Hearing in Animals

As I started searching for more information on this, I kept coming across things like this:
![news](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52544882-9f68fe00-2d81-11e9-8205-5e219b9a1b24.jpg)

News reports are mostly about marine life and the effect of noise pollution on them, but they aren't the only ones getting affected.

### Noise Pollution

What is noise pollution? A noise is an unwanted or inappropriate sound. Noise pollution is noise that interferes with normal activities, and disrupts or diminishes our quality of life. [PBS News Hour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/noise-pollution-humans-wreaking-havoc-u-s-wildlife)

**Noise Pollution Effects:**

* **Flying Species:**
  - Changes the distribution of birds, affecting trees and plants.
  - Some bird species have demonstrated adjustments to their vocal behaviour in an attempt to adapt. 
  - Some birds species have begun to sing at night.
  
* **Land Species:**
  - Female frogs have more difficulty locating the male's signal.
  - Reduces in the size of an area in which predators can hear their prey, and the ability of animals to avoid predators.
  - High-intensity sound induces fear, sometimes forcing species to abandon their habitat.
  - It can alter their established behaviours like vigilance, foraging, resting and their social interactions.

* **Marine Species:**
  - Damage a cetacean’s hearing and interfere with their sonar navigation system, leaving them stranded.
  - Physical trauma like bleeding around the ears, brain and other tissues, and air bubbles in their organs. ("The Bends")
  - Some species have started avoiding areas that were previously breeding or feeding grounds.
  - Different species have suffered behavioural changes when communicating.
  - Cephalopods suffer damage to their statocyst, the organ responsible for their maintaining balance in the water.

### Animal Pinnae

What is Pinnae? Pinnae are the external part of the ears in humans and other mammals. I decided to focus on the pinnae because I think it is something we often overlook or take for granted when we are thinking about hearing.

Some animals can swivel or rotate their pinnae in order to pinpoint where sounds are coming from. For predators, it is helpful while hunting, to find their prey, and for the animals being hunted, it helps them avoid predators.  

**Examples:**
* Foxes: Foxes can rotate pinnae up to 150 degrees.
* Canines
* Felines: Cats can rotate pinnae up to 180 degrees.
* Equines: Horses can rotate pinnae up to 180 degrees.
* Porcines
* Ungulates
* Rodents

### How can I design something that let's humans experience an animal's ability to rotate their pinna and focus on a sound?

**First Step: Interior Mechanism**

I started out by building out the mechanism I would need. I was going to use a servo motor to make the pinna rotate and since I wanted to somehow tie it back to muscle control, I decided to use a flex sensor. Bending the sensor with your finger would control the degrees of rotation of the servo.

This is what my circuit looks like:

<img width="794" alt="screen shot 2019-02-11 at 10 38 04 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52610149-e6242a00-2e4d-11e9-9b9f-3170496d15e3.png">

**Second Step: Code**

```C++
// Servo library

#include <Servo.h> 

Servo servo1;

const int flexpin = 0; 

void setup() 
{ 

  Serial.begin(9600);

  servo1.attach(7);
} 

void loop() 
{ 
  int flexposition;  
  int servoposition;   

  flexposition = analogRead(flexpin);

  servoposition = map(flexposition, 100, 300, 0, 180);
  servoposition = constrain(servoposition, 0, 180);


  servo1.write(servoposition);

  //Serial.print("sensor: ");
  //Serial.print(flexposition);
  //Serial.print("  servo: ");
  //Serial.println(servoposition);

  delay(20); 
}
```

**Fourth Step: Testing**

**Results:**

People found this fun and interesting. They really liked being able to control it with their finger. It did make them realize how hard it is to focus and pinpoint a sound in general, but even more when several things were happening around them.In terms of the volume, they could hear a slight change when rotating the ear towards a sound, but the motor and friction produced too much noise.

Ideally, this would be made out of nylon or with bearings to reduce friction and noise. The ear pinna is modeled after a small sized red fox ear, but maybe testing out larger sizes would make the effect greater.

## Enrichment I
## Vulpes vulpes: Hunting
02/18/2019

![red-fox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/52987581-b20ab500-33c9-11e9-87a6-63c6d9e4936c.png)

Vulpes vulpes, more commonly known as Red Foxes, are members of the Canidae family. They eat a variety of food, sometimes changing their diet from season to season. They are considered opportunistic feeders who will feed based on availability. Their diets usually include small rodents, rabbits, hare, insects, wild fruits and berries. Foxes are great at scavenging, hunting and caching. They carefully hide food for future us by burying it underground and disguising the spot with leaves and twigs. They will sometimes relocate their provisions.

Red Foxes are predators of small pray, these animals are high-strung and have quick reactions, which means that foxes have to stalk their prey quietly to be able to catch them. A fox's hearing is very sensitive to lower noises, frequencies that correspond to rustling and gnawing sounds of small animals. They are capable of locating sounds within inches of their exact location.

**Types of prey:**

J. David Henry groups the types of animals Red Foxes eat, into 4 main groups:

* **Insects:** Crickets, grasshoppers, and beetles. Sometimes flies and moths. 

* **Lagomorphs:** Includes rabbits and hares, who flee by running.

* **Small Burrowing Animals:** They flee down a burrow or dash under objects like rocks or fallen trees.

* **Arboreal Prey:** Birds and tree squirrels. These animals have high visual acuity, they flee upwards, and they keep a watch for predators from high perches.

The techniques that foxes use to hunts these types of prey is also different, each one unique to the circumstances. 

**Hunting Techniques:**

* **Insects:**
Hunting insects is something that foxes do more casually. Insects have weak escape behaviors, and they only provide the fox with a small amount of food. Usually, foxes are doing something else, and they hear an insect, and they simply walk over and bite down. When insects hop or fly away, they use their muzzle to poke around, or they do something called foot stamping. The foot stomping causes insects to move, and then the fox is able to locate them by the sound of rustling or movement.

![20180205_jennylynngolding_2216-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53015346-d93ca300-3418-11e9-8dc0-aadd084a8e3a.jpg)

* **Lagomorphs:**
These hunts start out with stalking and end up in pursuit. Usually, hares and rabbits bolt and flee as soon as they detect the fox, who then follows them galloping behind. The fox tries to get close and bit down on the leg or rump, which causes the prey to start zigzagging to create more distance between them. This can go on for a while, and two things can happen; either the hare escapes into a briar patch too dense for the fox, or the fox is able to catch the leg, pulling the hare off of its feet and they both fall to the ground. The fox then quickly stands up, pins it to the ground and bites its neck or head. 

![4ecd4cba-c26c-4b6a-b6a6-3008cfc80382_1 27207d037261c64657c4660e21a8cb1a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53015658-916a4b80-3419-11e9-807c-00d96d9d975c.jpg)

* **Small Burrowing Animals:**
A fox must approach these animals without making a sound. A cracking twig will cause the prey to stand completely still, making it hard for foxes to find them, or they will flee down a burrow. The hunt for these prey begins when a fox hears them and goes into mousing position. Mousing position is when a fox lifts its head and neck high and stares intently. They can try to locate the prey by scent, but more commonly, they tilt their heads trying to pinpoint their location by sound. If this doesn't work, they'll stalk their prey. They lower their head, crouch down slightly. To avoid making sounds, they place their forefoot down lightly and bring it back up to choose again, and then they place their back feet exactly where the front feet were. Once the prey was located, they go into mousing position to accurately pinpoint the location, they crouch deeply and lunges, arching through the air. At the end of the lunge, the fox tries to pin down its prey. 

![1048613_fox-jump-hunt-snow-winter-field-forest-tree-hd-wallpapers_1920x1280_h](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53015347-d93ca300-3418-11e9-9550-b149b3693650.jpg)

* **Arboreal Prey:**
When hunting birds or tree squirrels, foxes rarely lunge. They more commonly stalk their prey and charge them in a crouched dashing run. This is not their most successful hunting technique, so they do not really search for this type of prey, they hunt them if they encounter them in a vulnerable position. As soon as they see one on the ground, the fox crouches so low, that their belly is touching the ground, and remains completely still with its ears alert. The stalking pace then turns into a trot, then into a gallop, and then finally they charge, trying to catch the prey with their bite instead of a stab like it does with small burrowing animals. When hunting these type of prey, foxes try to synchronize their movement with the prey's movement to mask the sound, but the most crucial part of this hunting technique is minimizing visual cues. 

![c401794d018d42337e963edf961193c3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53015657-8fa08800-3419-11e9-87d3-22ad1a5bb9d3.jpg)

**Previous enrichment testing:**

[Feeding enrichment in an opportunistic carnivore: The red fox](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228488070_Feeding_enrichment_in_an_opportunistic_carnivore_The_red_fox)

Claudia Kistler,  Daniel Hegglin, Hanno Würbel, Barbara König

They compared four different methods of feeding enrichment that were based on natural foraging strategies of opportunistic carnivores, red foxes. The feeding enrichments consisted of electronic feeders delivering food unpredictable in time which were successively combined with one of the three additional treatments: a self-service food box, manually scattering food (unpredictable in space), and an electronic dispenser delivering food unpredictably both in space and time.

All four feeding enrichments significantly enhanced individual behavioural diversity and activity compared to a conventional feeding treatment. The proportion of food related, behaviour such as food searching or food acquiring increased the most during the feeding treatment with the highest spatial und temporal unpredictability. There was also an increase in exploratory behaviour such as locomotion and monitoring behaviour. The findings show that any kind of temporal and/or spatial unpredictability in the presentation of food has a stimulating effect on the foxes’ behavior.


### Enrichment Proposal 1:
This first proposal is inspired by the way in which foxes hunt small burrowing animals. The main parts of this hunting technique are the pinpointing of the sound, the stalking, the lunge, and the possibility of the animal escaping down a burrow if a sound is made. To engage a fox in this type of behavior, I thought about creating a small motorized container with a speaker and a sound detector. This container will enter the fox's habitat, play gnawing sounds pertaining to small animals to attract the fox. Ideally, the fox becomes engaged and start stalking it. The moment the fox makes a sound, the sound sensor will detect it, and turn on the motors to make it run away from the fox as a small animal would. For the fox to get to the container, he will have to be completely silent. The sound sensor would have to be configured to detect very low frequencies, so only something like the sound of a breaking twig would set the container running.  In this type of hunting, foxes try to pin down their prey before biting, so ideally the fox would not bite down on the container, and it could be reused.

![proposali](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53016879-aa283080-341c-11e9-8ffc-a08d80480980.jpg)

### Enrichment Proposal 2:
This second proposal comes from the hunting of arboreal prey. Foxes are usually very unsuccessful with this type of prey, but it is an interesting one because they rely on hiding and the element of surprise. This type of hunting rellies more on visual cues than on sound signals. The fox has to see this type of prey on the ground, in a vulnerable position to try to hunt them, and he has to avoid being seen or else, the prey will flee. For this second proposal, I had in mind a hanging motorized food tray with some type of movement sensor, either ultrasonic or infrared and fishing wire. This would ideally hang from the top of the cage. The motor would unwind the wire, lowering the tray to the ground, trying to get the fox to engage with it visually and through smell. The fox would have to approach the tray very stealthily and quickly try to catch it. Otherwise, the motion detector would see it and immediately activate the motor that would send the tray back up, imitating a bird or squirrel fleeing up. This could be repeated several times until the fox is able to catch it, or it could be done once throughout the day, whether successful or not, just like it would happen in nature.

## Enrichment II
## Preybot
02/21/2019

Based on the feedback, I have decided to move forward with my second enrichment proposal. My proposal is a preybot that mimics the behavior of a fox's arboreal prey, which consists of birds and tree squirrels. These animals have high visual acuity, and they flee upwards, which makes it really hard for foxes to catch them. They have a specific technique for hunting this type of prey: They see one on the ground, they crouch until their belly is touching the ground, and remain completely still with its ears alert. They start stalking the prey, they get closet and go into a trot, then into a gallop, and then finally they charge, trying to bite the animal. The most crucial part of this hunting technique is minimizing visual cues.

I want to build a device that hangs from the top mesh of the fox's habitat. Using a motor and fishing wire, the device can move food up and down. The idea is to lower food to the ground, catching the foxes eye by making it seem attainable. At the bottom of the wire, right above the food, a motion sensor will be "standing guard," if it senses the fox, it sends a signal to the Arduino and the motor gets activated, reeling the food back up. The fox has to apply his arboreal prey hunting technique to be able to get past the sensor and bite the food.

**Things to consider:**

- Size of the spool: Apart from taking into consideration the speed and amount of torque that I need in the motor, the size of the spool also plays a significant role when it comes to the speed of the reeling. The wider the spool, the faster the food can move up and down. 

- Type of sensor: Infrared sensors work better with light, but foxes do not only hunt during the day. An ultrasonic sensor makes more sense because it would make the preybot functional at all times. 

- Hanging Structure: Different zoos and rescue habitats have different meshes to contain the foxes, so creating a hook might limit the number of places it can be used. I want to create two small arms that you can slide onto square wooden dowels or metal extrusions so that the machine can hang from any mesh.

- Wire vs. Fixed Structure: Because of how this is designed, this device will behave like a pendulum, so the sensor won't always be looking to the same direction, but I think it will help create more of a challenge. In *Feeding enrichment in an opportunistic carnivore: The red fox*, they found that unpredictability in the presentation of food has a stimulating effect on the foxes’ behavior, so the unpredictability of the direction of the sensor should be a good thing. Also, in terms of mimicking nature, it makes sense not to have the sensor fixed because the prey's eyes are never fixed either. 

- Food Container: I had initially thought of hanging a tray that would contain the food, but because of the way in which these animals are hunted, I do not believe this is the right direction. I think the food should hang more freely, without being contained in something that is not edible, that way then the foxes charge and try to bite it, it happens more naturally than them trying to get it off the tray. I am thinking of a hook, something soft in case the fox bites into it, but sturdy enough to hang food from it.

## Enrichment Prototype
02/26/2019

This machine is a preybot that tries to mimic the fleeing upward behavior of a fox's arboreal prey. These type of prey consists of birds and tree squirrels, which have high visual acuity. The idea with this machine is to encourage hunting behaviors in foxes. The device lowers food to the ground, making it seem attractive, like a bird or squirrel that is on the ground in a vulnerable position. The machine has a motion sensor that can detect when the fox is getting close, just like a bird can detect it with their eyes. When hunting this type of prey, foxes stalk their prey in a deeply crouched posture and then try to catch the animal in a dashing run. The fox needs to practice this technique to be able to avoid the motion sensor, and it has to be fast enough to catch the food before that happens. If the motion sensor senses the fox, it'll automatically pull the food up, like a bird fleeing upwards.

## Zoo Visit
## Central Park Zoo
03/04/2019

During my visit to the Central Park Zoo, I decided to observe lemurs, because there were no foxes I could observe. The type of lemurs they have is Ruffed Lemurs, and they can be found in the [Tropic Zone: The Rainforest Exhibit](https://centralparkzoo.com/exhibits/tropic-zone-the-rainforest).

### Ethogram

I had a hard time trying to observe these lemurs because they are incredibly fast and they move all over the place. I went from trying to do my ethogram right there to try to record them, but that wasn't completely successful either. I kept losing the lemur I had chosen to follow because they either jumped behind a tree and I no longer was sure I was following the same one when it came from behind it, or sometimes I couldn't move around because people were watching the lemurs. I have several short clips of different lemurs, but I did successfully follow the same one for 12 minutes and 35 seconds. For this round of ethograms, I decided to do instantaneous sampling with my time interval being 30 seconds. 

![lemur - sheet1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53781282-33883a00-3ed6-11e9-8988-ff7a6c7a190b.jpg)

I was not a fan of the instantaneous sampling because I observed so many interesting behaviors that I wanted to put down, but they would happen in between my intervals. I think even though continuous is hard to do, it is my favorite technique so far.

## Pet Store Visit
## Boris & Horton Cafe
03/04/2019

Boris & Horton opened its doors for the first time in the summer of 2018. The idea was to have a place where you could have great coffee, eat, have wine and beer, hang out, but most importantly, bring your dog inside. For this to happen, the space had to be formally divided into two distinct spaces: a café side, with food and drink sales, and a dog side, featuring tables and dog-centric store. There is an outdoor window where you can order your drink or food and then walk into the dog side. 

![bh_colorlogo_transparent_800x800_5b98fe56-24d9-4d12-88fd-9885685d293f_280x 2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53781624-8d3d3400-3ed7-11e9-9be3-23225172f05c.png)

### Observations:

From the very beginning, this "puppy cafe" was completely anthropocentric. Even one of the owners, Logan Mikhly says: “We’re a dog-friendly cafe, but not a dog cafe.” He also added: “We’re a solution for people who have dogs or are interested in coming to an adoption event." The cafe opened up so people could go out and get coffee, wine or beer, without feeling bad about leaving their dogs alone in their homes. 

When you walk in, you see one of the few dog-centric objects in the cafe, the entrance doors. The cafe has two doors; as soon as you approach the first one, you can see a sign that reminds you to make sure only one door is open time because there are unleashed dogs that could run out into the streets if both doors are open at the same time. Once inside, there is a pet store, with items that the dogs cannot interact with, but that is also completely anthropomorphized like toys that look like champagne bottles or sushi. They have different types of treats, some of them promise to freshen up your dog's breath, which is something I do not believe dogs care about. They have coats and jackets that although seem “stylish” do not seem very functional when it comes to keeping a dog warm, and within this same idea, they also sell bandanas for dogs. 

![img_2887](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782336-d80c7b00-3eda-11e9-93a4-a2f10961f7ba.jpg)

![img_5843](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782338-d80c7b00-3eda-11e9-96bc-ae18d06a90c3.jpg)

![img_5325](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782341-d80c7b00-3eda-11e9-84e2-49b06eb37d16.jpg)

Past the store, there are a lot of tables and chairs for people to sit down and drink their coffee or work. Dogs are allowed to jump on the seats and rest there, but the seats are completely designed for humans. There are not dog-friendly resting areas or items. In between the tables, there is a photo booth where people take pictures with their dogs, and there are two trunks next to it full of dog costumes for people to dress up their dogs. I have never seen a dog excited about getting one of these on. Next, to the trunks, they also have a kissing booth that can be set up in front of the camera, so the “pooch” is behind it. 

![img_5235](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782335-d80c7b00-3eda-11e9-9f06-289ee6fe7da1.jpg)

![img_9024](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782342-d8a51180-3eda-11e9-9015-c13367bbe86a.jpg)

Behind the photo booth, there is a big sign with the rules of the place, which make a lot of sense, but at the same time, they limit certain behaviors that are natural in dogs. We saw a couple of dogs playing around, sometimes it seemed like it was getting a little too rough and people would get their dogs to split them up, but they ended up doing it again. It is hard to know when they are being playful and when they are being aggressive. 

![img_5846](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43420227/53782337-d80c7b00-3eda-11e9-81fa-762718e6accb.jpg)

Overall it is a nice place, people seem to enjoy having their pets around and being able to play with other people’s dogs, but it doesn’t seem that great for dogs. Something very interesting is that several people sat on the floor to interact with the dogs, which I think is very dog-centric. 


### Redesign:

1. Add resting areas for dogs

1. Add pet relief area

1. Educate people about play behavior
